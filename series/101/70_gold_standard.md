The gold standard is aimed at pointing new comers to the best solutions available at the moment.
It is not so important how fancy they are. The key focus should be how easy they are to use and understand.

Our recommended gold standard:

* event system: `biojs-events`
* documentation framework
* build system: gulp?
* testing framework: mocha?
* CI server: travis?
* Linting?
* Visualisation: D3?
* Contribution Guidelines: in addition to those included in README (https://github.com/biojs/biojs)?


(feel free to continue)

{% alert warn %}
TODO: Maybe we can write a short intro and howto for those (if not already covered by the 101) or at least link to an intro.
{% endalert %}

`?` means most likely (if you don't disagree - if you do disagree please contribute to the discussion)
