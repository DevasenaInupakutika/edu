Gold standard
-------------

Not needed, but highly recommended.

The gold standard is aimed at pointing new comers to the best solutions available at the moment.
It is not so important how fancy they are. The key focus should be how easy they are to use and understand.

For the use of every item you will be rewarded by badges in the registry.
